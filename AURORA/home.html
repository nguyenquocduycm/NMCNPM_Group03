            Popular products like Agoda, booking.com, mytour, trivago, etc. help us making reservations when we travel. The biggest advantage is that those products have existed for years and have good standings in the booking eco systems and also because people are already used to using them that they don't feel that they have to try out new things out of the fear of higher price or more importantly, having less choices of hotels as well as security risks. Recently, these products got updated with more features like supporting many discounts and customers love them. For us to have a position is this booking eco system, having customers is very important by spending a lot on marketing, our product has new features like adding support for people who travel for work instead of having fun, they can choose that as their travelling purpose and it will suggests them suitable hotels to book for that purpose with the help of Artificial Intelligence. We hope our product when released to public will have a place of its own and continue to develope further.
